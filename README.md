# Frost_CSCI2270_FinalProject

Project Summary:

For my final project in this class, I will be modifying a previous HW assignment to include additional functionality. The assignment will be assignment 4, where we used enqueue and dequeue to transmit a message from city to city. The additional functionality that I will be adding will be related to the message itself; I would like to include options to modify the message, and change an output file to include a message of which city the message was modified in, and possibly even something like a timestamp. I am attempting to create a “post-apocalyptic” messaging system, which can be used between main city hubs to communicate with each-other (as well as update the message, and see who the last city to update or change it was.) I might even include message history in a “show-file log,” so that you can see when it was changed. 

How to Run:

I will be using a menu-style function, which will allow the user to make changes to the message, and log which node changed it.
